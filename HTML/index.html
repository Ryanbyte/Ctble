  <h1>Ctble</h1>
    <center>
      <p>Ctble is a collection of functions in Lua that provide a wide range of operations on tables. Tables in Lua are the primary data structure, and they are used to represent arrays, records, objects, and more. Ctble provides functions to create, manipulate, and traverse tables.

        <p>The module includes functions for sorting, searching, inserting, and removing elements in tables. It also includes functions to concatenate tables, check for table membership, and iterate over table elements. Some of the more advanced functions in the table module include deep copying and merging of tables, as well as operations on tables as sets.</p>
          
        <p>Overall, Ctble is a powerful tool for working with Lua tables. Its many functions allow for efficient and flexible manipulation of data structures in Lua, making it a critical component of Lua programming.</p>
